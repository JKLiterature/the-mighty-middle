## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Research Question
1. Open the Literature Review Tracker in your web browser
2. At the top of the page, you'll see a section for your research question
3. Replace the example text with your actual research question
4. This will help you stay focused when evaluating source relevance

### Understanding the Interface
- **Header**: Displays your research question and project title
- **Controls**: Filtering and search options
- **Statistics**: Real-time overview of your literature collection
- **Main Table**: Your literature database
- **Add New Entry**: Form at the bottom for adding sources

## Adding Literature

### Required Fields
When adding a new source, you must fill in:
- **Citation**: Full citation in your preferred format
- **Year**: Publication year
- **Type**: Choose from Theoretical, Empirical, Methodological, or Literature Review
- **Framework**: Select the relevant theoretical framework(s)
- **Relevance**: Rate as High, Medium, or Low relevance to your research

### Recommended Fields
For maximum utility, also complete:
- **Connection to Research Question**: Explain how this source relates to your research
- **Key Concepts/Findings**: Main ideas, arguments, or findings
- **Domain of Power**: If using Collins' framework, specify relevant domains
- **Notes & Quotes**: Important excerpts, page numbers, your thoughts
- **Page References**: Specific pages or chapters you've referenced

### Adding Multiple Frameworks
If a source addresses multiple theoretical frameworks:
1. Select the primary framework from the dropdown
2. In your notes, mention additional frameworks
3. Use tags in your notes like "#AsianCrit #Intersectionality"

## Organizing Your Sources

### Theoretical Frameworks
The tracker includes common frameworks:
- **Collins' Domains of Power**: Structural, disciplinary, cultural, interpersonal
- **Asian American Critical Race Theory (AsianCrit)**
- **Model Minority Myth Literature**
- **Autoethnography**
- **Intersectionality**

### Relevance Levels
- **High**: Directly addresses your research question
- **Medium**: Provides important context or related findings
- **Low**: Background information or tangentially related

### Source Types
- **Theoretical**: Conceptual frameworks, theoretical arguments
- **Empirical**: Research studies with data collection
- **Methodological**: Focus on research methods
- **Literature Review**: Systematic reviews of existing research

## Filtering and Searching

### Framework Filter
- Select a specific framework to see only related sources
- Useful for checking coverage across different theoretical approaches

### Relevance Filter
- Filter by High/Medium/Low to focus on your most important sources
- Use "High" filter when writing key sections of your literature review

### Search Function
Search across multiple fields:
- Author names and citations
- Key concepts and findings
- Your notes and quotes
- Use keywords related to your research themes

### Combining Filters
- Use multiple filters simultaneously for precise results
- Example: "AsianCrit" framework + "High" relevance for core theoretical sources

## Exporting Data

### CSV Export
1. Click "Export to CSV" to download your complete database
2. Open in Excel, Google Sheets, or other spreadsheet software
3. Useful for:
   - Creating backup copies
   - Advanced analysis and sorting
   - Sharing with advisors or colleagues

### Bibliography Generation
1. Click "Generate Bibliography" for a formatted reference list
2. Sources are automatically sorted alphabetically
3. Copy and paste into your document
4. Remember to format according to your citation style

### Research Gap Analysis
1. Click "Analyze Research Gaps" for automated analysis
2. Shows distribution across:
   - Theoretical frameworks
   - Power domains (if using Collins)
   - Source types
3. Identifies areas needing more sources

## Advanced Features

### Statistics Dashboard
Monitor your literature collection:
- **Total Sources**: Overall count
- **High Relevance**: Number of highly relevant sources
- **Theoretical vs. Empirical**: Balance of source types

### Data Persistence
- Your data is automatically saved in your browser
- Data persists between sessions
- Export regularly as backup

### Collaborative Features
- Export your database to share with advisors
- Import standardized templates for research teams
- Use consistent frameworks across projects

## Tips and Best Practices

### Organization Strategy
1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general sources, then narrow focus
2. **Regular Updates**: Add sources immediately after reading
3. **Consistent Tagging**: Use consistent language for frameworks and concepts
4. **Quality Notes**: Write detailed notes while reading, not just citations

### Literature Review Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: Collect and categorize all relevant sources
2. **Phase 2**: Use filters to focus on high-relevance sources for writing
3. **Phase 3**: Export and organize by themes for your literature review

### Maintaining Quality
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and update relevance ratings
- **Gap Analysis**: Use the analysis tool monthly to identify missing areas
- **Validation**: Cross-check your framework categorizations

### Citation Management
- **Consistent Format**: Choose one citation style and stick to it
- **Complete Information**: Include all necessary citation elements
- **Page Numbers**: Always include specific page references in notes

### Collaboration Tips
- **Shared Standards**: Agree on framework definitions with your team
- **Regular Exports**: Share updated databases with collaborators
- **Version Control**: Use date stamps when sharing files

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Saving
- Ensure you're using a modern browser
- Check that cookies/local storage are enabled
- Export data regularly as backup

### Filters Not Working
- Clear all filters and try again
- Refresh the page if issues persist
- Check for typos in search terms

### Export Issues
- Try a different browser if exports fail
- Ensure pop-ups are enabled for the site
- Check your download folder for exported files

### Performance with Large Databases
- Consider archiving older or less relevant sources
- Use filters to work with smaller subsets
- Export and work in external tools for very large collections (1000+ sources)
