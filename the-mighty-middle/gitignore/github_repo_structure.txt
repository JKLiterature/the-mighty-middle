## 🛠️ Customization

The tracker is designed to be easily customizable for different research domains:

### Adding New Theoretical Frameworks
Edit the framework options in `js/app.js`:
```javascript
const frameworks = [
    'Collins Domains of Power',
    'Critical Race Theory',
    'Your Custom Framework'
];
```

### Modifying Research Domains
Update the domain categories in the configuration:
```javascript
const researchDomains = [
    'Structural',
    'Disciplinary', 
    'Cultural',
    'Interpersonal',
    'Your Custom Domain'
];
```

### Styling Customization
Modify colors and themes in `css/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    --accent-color: #38a169;
}
```
